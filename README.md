## Java Data Structure

> Have mastery over the Java **core**. Be *amazing* in data structure.

Think of a **ferris wheel**: for every time it turns, for every new person that enters it, you'll have new technologies to master.

However, the foundation, the base concepts and how they function remains the same, so the closer you are to the center the better. Be at the core: data structure, core
language, memory consumption and so on.

> Be a software engineer, know how it works, master your OS, master the terminal, learn Math.

> Developing software means solving problems. 

> Enjoy solving problems and stop complaining about this and that!

> Problem solving is nice and it can be even more fun if you think outside the box.
